💰 Web Budget Calculator — Sprint 6

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/qLNQwYYS/images.gif" alt="Demo" width="600" />

This project is part of Sprint 6 of the IT Academy Bootcamp. The goal was to deepen our understanding of React by creating reusable and scalable components that interact through props at different levels.

🚀 Technologies Used
React (with TypeScript)

React Router

Vite

Tailwind CSS

📌 Project Status
The MVP is complete and fully functional, except for the last exercise, which I couldn’t finish due to time constraints. Below is the timeline for this sprint: Sprint End Planned: 18-07-2025

🛠️ Getting Started

1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Clos266/web-budget-calculator
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Run the development server

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

📈 Future Improvements
Add tests (though I haven’t fully mastered the basics yet, so I’m not sure how to approach testing at this stage).

Refactor all text content to be consistently in English (currently there's some Spanglish/Catanglish).

Improve folder structure — this is my second React project and my first one using React Router, so things got a bit messy.

Split large files that contain too much logic or too many responsibilities.

Add smooth page transitions and animations to improve user experience — although for now, my priority is mastering React before diving into more advanced visual polish.
